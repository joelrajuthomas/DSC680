### DSC680 Projects
This is a repo designated for all projects in this class and other projects I've completed in the past at my time at Bellevue University studying a Masters' in Data Science.
Please feel free to look through the content in the folders and see what models and presentations were done in my time here.


Current Projects in the Repo
# Heart Disease Prediction via Logistic Regression.
This project highlights logistic regression in determing wheter a patient's blood markers, physical status, and diet can predict having heart disease.

# Diagnosing Diabetes via Blood CBC Data.
Given Whole CBC Data (Complete Blood Cell) tests, I utilize Random Cut Machine learning analysis techniques to determine if a patient is at risk of having Diabetes. 

# Determining Student Satisfaction using Machine Learning over Survey Respondents
Given a dataset from students, we determine positive/negative trends amongst answers provided for satisfaction surveys to further enhance school board's ability to improve metrics for following years curriculums. 

# Predict Cat/Dog images using TensorFlow 
With a selection of 2500 cat and dog images, we are able to train a model using an Image Data generator to classify these images to flattened binary files. They are then tested on single images to determine if they are indeed a cat or dog image. 

# Steam Game Price Prediction based off historical Steam prices for games
Given a dataset of steam sales from game releases, we attempt to predict prices for games by only knowing their initial features of the game.

# Pizza or Not Pizza! TensorFlow Image Prediction
Given images of pizza and images that are not pizza - We predict if given images are pizza or not!
