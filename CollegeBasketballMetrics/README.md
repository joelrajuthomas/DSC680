We make a bar chart shows how many teams ended up in each postseason ranking category, giving us a sense of the distribution. A correlation heatmap reveals which features are most related to postseason success. A scatter plot compares predicted rankings with actual ones, visually checking our model's accuracy; and a bar chart highlights the importance of each feature in predicting rankings.
